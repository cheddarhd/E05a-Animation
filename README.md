# E05a-Animation

This is a really cool building block for what we are doing with our next assignment. I didn't think that movement with sprites and a keyboard was going to be as easy as using x and y for position on a grid. I thought it would be more difficult but I understood what most of the functions in the game were doing with a few exceptions that had me confused.
